# Vercel Routing Fix for React SPA

## ❌ Problem

When clicking the Eye icon in Admin Dashboard to view blog detail, a 404 error occurred:
```
404: NOT_FOUND
URL: skin-vox.vercel.app/blog/68fd6aa53ecf0e5caf86cd42
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The Vercel routing configuration in `vercel.json` was not properly set up for a React Single Page Application (SPA). All routes were being treated as static files, causing Vercel to return 404 for client-side routes like `/blog/:id`.

## ✅ Solution

Updated `vercel.json` to properly handle SPA routing:

```json
"routes": [
  {
    "src": "/assets/(.*)",
    "dest": "/client/public/assets/$1"
  },
  {
    "src": "/(.*\\.(js|css|ico|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot))",
    "dest": "/client/dist/$1"
  },
  {
    "src": "/(.*)",
    "dest": "/client/dist/index.html"
  }
]
```

### Explanation

1. **First route**: Serves assets from `/client/public/assets/`
2. **Second route**: Serves static files (JS, CSS, images, fonts) from `/client/dist/`
3. **Third route (NEW)**: **Fallback route** that serves `index.html` for any other path

The fallback route ensures that:
- User navigates to `/blog/123` → Vercel serves `index.html`
- React Router takes over and handles the `/blog/123` route
- No 404 error!

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. Commit and push changes:
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing for React SPA"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically redeploy

3. Test the fix:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Click Eye icon on any blog
   - Should open blog detail without 404 error

## 📝 How SPA Routing Works

**Traditional Web Apps:**
- `/blog/123` → Server looks for `/blog/123/index.html` → 404 if not found

**Single Page Apps (React Router):**
- `/blog/123` → Server serves `index.html` → React Router reads URL → Renders correct component

**Vercel Config:**
- The fallback route (`"dest": "/client/dist/index.html"`) ensures all routes serve the React app
- React Router then handles routing on the client side

## ✅ Testing

After deployment:
1. Navigate to `/blog` - should work ✅
2. Navigate to `/blog/68fd6aa53ecf0e5caf86cd42` - should work ✅
3. Navigate to any other route - should work ✅
4. Refresh on `/blog/123` - should work ✅ (previously would 404)
