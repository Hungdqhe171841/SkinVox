## 📋 Summary

Enhanced error logging for the admin image upload functionality to help diagnose and fix the 500 error and 404 errors.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Backend (`server/routes/admin.js`)

**Enhanced Logging:**
- Added detailed logs at each step of the upload process
- Added file-by-file upload progress logging
- Added error stack traces in development mode
- Added more specific error messages

**Error Handling Improvements:**
- Better error messages for Cloudinary upload failures
- Detailed error logging with stack traces
- File-specific error reporting

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. 500 Error on Upload

**Possible Causes:**
- Cloudinary credentials not configured
- File size too large (>5MB)
- Invalid file format
- Network issues

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Cloudinary environment variables are set:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
3. Check file size and format
4. Verify network connectivity

### 2. 404 Error on Dashboard

**Possible Causes:**
- API endpoint not found
- Route not properly registered
- Server not running

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check if server is running
2. Verify API endpoint URL in frontend
3. Check server logs for routing errors

## 📊 Logging Output

The enhanced logging will now show:
